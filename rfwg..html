Professional writers need accurate statistics, authoritative quotations, historical background, scholarly conjecture, biographical tidbits, arcane facts, and detailed explanations of every process, theory, concept, methodology, and function imaginable. 

Research adds authority and color to writing. Few writers, including fiction writers, can enchant their readers with pure imagination unspeckled with reality. The facts need to be there. 
Research can take up a lot of a writerâ€™s time. Frustrating dead ends add to the wasted time.
We can save writers time by researching their needs to develop their stories.
  Some examples:
Detective/crime stories. Information that may be needed is location information, forensics, criminal profiling, and detective techniques and skills. 
Spy/espionage.  Information-gathering techniques, tools of the trade, information about the countries the spy is working in, what kind of training a spy goes through, places where he is taught, and much more.
Technical information for science fiction stories, such as computers, and how things work. 
History-related stories. What was living in a period of time like? What kind of clothes did they wear? Who were noted people of that time? What kind of food and drink did they have access to?
